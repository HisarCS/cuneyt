This Readme will be updated in the near future, 
meanwhile you can refer to comments in the library functions as reference.
Here are instructions on how to install the complete cuneyt system:

##Installation
Cuneyt has a really simple installation script, install.sh, that sets up your Raspberry Pi system with the complete Cuenyt system and dependencies. 
You will need a Raspberry Pi 3 (or older Raspberry Pi models with Internet Connection) with Raspbian installed. For more information on how to do this visit: [The Raspberry Pi Noobs Webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs)
Once you have a Raspberry Pi with Raspian:
* download install.sh
* move install.sh to the directory you want to work in (e.g. Desktop)
* navigate to said directory from your terminal
* run the command `sudo bash install.sh`
* Confirm when the installer asks you to do so
* After setup is complete run `python` and `import cuneyt` to check installation
